## General info
This is a personal poject that I wan to convert to a library. The idea of the repository
is to provide the people following me the steps I follow to develop a full python app.
The objective of this course is that people can follow my commits and understand the obstacles I find
on the way and how I solve them. In theory, anyone that follows my code and the execution
with their own LIST OF CAMPAIGNS will be able to:

1. Download data using my filesystem that allows the user to execute and save webscraping data from
recent kickstarter campaigns.
2. Have a control of the execution and recollection of data using google instances.
3. Analize and clean that information.
4. Incorporate previous information (Collected data, monthly reported) for a better analysis or create more robust models
5. Create a forecast model out of the recollected data.
6. If we have enough time we will deploy that model with flask to create an app.

## Why?

I'm launching my own Kickstarte campaign and I'm worried because it seem that kickstarter traffic is beign affected by COVID19
I want to have as precise information as possible to take the best strategy for my campaign. I think is a good practical problem
that will involve many tasks in python until we reach our final product which is a model that makes prediction ans allows me
to see my data in real time. I have been working developing projects and makig consultancy. If anyone is interested in developing this kind of
prjects this is a good user case. After completing my objective I will update and improve my code
to build a more robust and friendly user app. If you stick to the project I will describe the evolution of the project in the commits and documentation
