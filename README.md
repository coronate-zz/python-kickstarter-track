## General info
This is a personal poject that I wan to convert to a library. The idea of the repository
is to provide the people following me the steps I follow to develop a full python app.
The objective of this course is that people can follow my commits and understand the obstacles I find
on the way and how I solve them. In theory, anyone that follows my code and the execution
with their own LIST OF CAMPAIGNS will be able to:

1. Download data using my filesystem that allows the user to execute and save webscraping data from
recent kickstarter campaigns.
2. Have a control of the execution and recollection of data using google instances.
3. Analize and clean that information.
4. Incorporate previous information (Collected data, monthly reported) for a better analysis or create more robust models
5. Create a forecast model out of the recollected data.
6. If we have enough time we will deploy that model with flask to create an app.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python: 3.7.3
